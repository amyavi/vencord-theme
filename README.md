# vencord-theme
my personal vencord theme  
generally just removes small little thingamabobs that i don't really want to see while using discord

## building
run `npm run build`

build output will be in `build/theme.css`, you can directly import that in vencord

## configuration
edit `src/main.scss` and comment out the lines that you don't want
